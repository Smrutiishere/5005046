Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:
Description: Each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Traversal is unidirectional (from head to end).
Operations: Insertions and deletions are efficient (O(1)) at the head. For other positions, you must traverse the list (O(n)).
Doubly Linked List:
Description: Each node contains data and references to both the next and the previous nodes. Traversal can be bidirectional.
Operations: Insertions and deletions are efficient (O(1)) at any position if you have a reference to the node. It requires more memory due to the extra reference.
Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions can be performed efficiently without needing to shift elements (O(1) if the node reference is available).
Memory Utilization: Linked lists use memory more efficiently for dynamic datasets since they only allocate memory as needed.

Analysis
Time Complexity of Each Operation:

Add Task:

Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case (if the list needs to be traversed to find the end).
Search Task by ID:

Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case (linear search through the list).
Delete Task by ID:

Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case (linear search through the list to find the task and update pointers).
Traverse and Display Tasks:

Time Complexity: O(n), as it involves iterating through the entire list.
Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays for Dynamic Data:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike arrays which require a predefined size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements can be done efficiently (O(1) if the node reference is available) without the need to shift elements as in arrays.
Memory Utilization: Memory is allocated as needed, potentially saving space compared to arrays with unused allocated capacity.
When to Use Linked Lists:

Linked lists are particularly useful when the number of elements can change frequently, and efficient insertions and deletions are required.
They are less suitable when frequent random access or fixed-size data is needed, where arrays or other data structures might be more appropriate.
