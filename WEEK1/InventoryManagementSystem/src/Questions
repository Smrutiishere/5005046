Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential?

Efficiency: Managing a large inventory involves a lot of data manipulation. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial for performance, especially when dealing with thousands or millions of products.
Scalability: As the number of products grows, the system should handle increased load without significant performance degradation.
Quick Access: Fast access to product information is necessary for real-time operations such as checking stock levels, updating quantities, or processing sales.

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

Types of Data Structures Suitable for the Problem:

ArrayList: A dynamic array that can be resized. Good for cases where you need indexed access and the number of products is not excessively large. However, it may not be efficient for searching or updating specific products unless you maintain a separate index.

HashMap: A key-value pair storage where keys are unique identifiers (e.g., 'productId') and values are the product objects. Provides efficient O(1) average-time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

TreeMap: A sorted map that provides log(n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Useful if you need products to be stored in a sorted order based on productId.

For an inventory management system, HashMap is generally the most appropriate due to its efficiency in performing frequent operations on large datasets.

Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Operation (addProduct):
HashMap: O(1) average-case time complexity. This is because inserting an element into a HashMap generally requires constant time.
Update Operation (updateProduct):
HashMap: O(1) average-case time complexity. Updating an entry involves a retrieval followed by an update, both of which are constant time operations.
Delete Operation (deleteProduct):
HashMap: O(1) average-case time complexity. Removing an element involves a lookup followed by deletion, both of which are constant time operations.
Optimization:

Collision Handling: Ensure that the hash function used by HashMap minimizes collisions,
 which can degrade performance. This is generally handled internally,
  but choosing a good hash function is important for large-scale systems.

Load Factor and Resizing: Adjust the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap 
to balance memory use and performance based on the expected size of the inventory.

By using a HashMap for your inventory management system, you achieve efficient data access and modification operations, making it suitable for handling large inventories.
