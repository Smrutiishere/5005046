Exercise 6: Library Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.
Steps:
Understand Search Algorithms:
Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
Setup:
Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.
Implementation:
Implement linear search to find books by title.
Implement binary search to find books by title (assuming the list is sorted).
Analysis:
Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

Linear Search:
Searches each element in the list sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because each element must be checked one by one.

Binary Search:
 Searches for an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value to the middle element and reduces the search interval accordingly.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is due to the halving of the search space with each iteration.


Analysis
Time Complexity:

Linear Search:

Average Time Complexity: O(n) because it may need to examine each book in the array.
Best Case: O(1) if the book is found at the first position.
Worst Case: O(n) if the book is at the end of the list or not present.
Binary Search:

Average Time Complexity: O(log n) because it repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
Best Case: O(1) if the book is found in the middle of the list.
Worst Case: O(log n) for a list of size n.
When to Use Each Algorithm:

Linear Search:

When the list is unsorted or the dataset is small.
When simplicity is preferred and sorting the list is not feasible.
Binary Search:

When the list is sorted or can be sorted.
When searching needs to be efficient, especially for large datasets.
Requires additional time and effort to sort the list if itâ€™s not already sorted.
