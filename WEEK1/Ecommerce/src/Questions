Understanding Asymptotic Notation
Big O Notation:

Definition: Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm’s time complexity, providing an estimate of the algorithm’s performance as the input size grows. It helps in understanding how the runtime of an algorithm scales with increasing input size.

Purpose: It abstracts away constants and lower-order terms, focusing on the most significant factors affecting performance. This allows for the comparison of different algorithms based on their efficiency.

Search Operation Scenarios:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1)
Occurs when the target element is the first element in the list.
Average Case: O(n)
The target element could be anywhere in the list, requiring on average n/2 comparisons.
Worst Case: O(n)
The target element is either the last element or not in the list, requiring n comparisons.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1)
Occurs when the target element is exactly in the middle of the sorted array.
Average Case: O(log n)
The algorithm divides the search space in half with each step, leading to a logarithmic number of comparisons.
Worst Case: O(log n)
The algorithm continues halving the search space until the target is found or the search space is empty.

Suitability for Your Platform:

Binary Search is generally more suitable for an e-commerce platform where search performance is critical and the product list can be large. It offers logarithmic time complexity, making it more efficient for large datasets compared to linear search’s linear time complexity.

Linear Search can be used for smaller datasets or when sorting the array is not feasible. It does not require the data to be sorted but is less efficient for larger datasets due to its O(n) complexity.

Summary: For an e-commerce platform, where performance is essential, binary search is preferred due to its faster average and worst-case time complexity compared to linear search. Ensure that the product array is sorted before using binary search, and leverage linear search for unsorted or smaller datasets.
